## Plot

Kevin woke to the sound of traffic. Staring out the window of his room, the dreariness of the city was worsened as the sky began to darken.
After his typical breakfast, of toast and an egg, he left for school.
Normally Kevin would have walked down Bleaker streat, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Kevin’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he mooved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick floiage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo. He could hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Kevin had heard the sounds before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Kevin would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Suddenly, the zoo keeper leapt out of the fern bushes and challenged Kevin to a duel of the minds! If Kevin could defeat the zoo keeper, Kevin would be given the opportunity to have one wish granted by the Unicorn King.

After completing the Trials of the Zoo, Kevin was granted a meeting with the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers.
The end.
